# Project Description (from Canvas)
## Marine Corps Customer Experience Enhancement

**Project Overview:** Marine Corps Community Services (MCCS/HQ USMC) will partner with Virginia Tech Innovation campus to provide students a Project Based Learning opportunity. This project offers graduate students a chance to collaborate with professionals across disciplines and contribute to an innovative customer engagement strategy that emphasizes personalization, efficiency, and security.

**Background:** MCCS is an organization within the Marine Corps that strengthens and enables quality of life, mission readiness and lethality through programs and services for Marines and families. An example of the breadth of programs and services provided can be viewed here: [Pendleton](usmc-mccs.org)
- Adapt and Thrive: MCCS responds to the changing needs of Marines and families, in life and for duty. We meet challenges together to adapt and overcome. We give Marines the foundation they need to lean forward, achieve life milestones, stay resilient and always be ready to deploy.

- **Purpose-driven programs and solutions:** MCCS knows what it takes to be a Marine. Services and programs are targeted with the end in mind, solutions to help Marines and families win life’s battles.

- **Problem:** MCCS is committed to providing a highly differentiated and interconnected system-of-services, knowing Marine’s, and meeting their GSD needs to stay mission ready, whenever and wherever they’re tasked Unfortunately, our Marines are subject to generic experiences contained within fragmented silos. Our Marines need a tailored solution created through a collaborative effort between MCCS, technology, and external partners. How might we dynamically curate experiences to each Marine contextually tailored seamlessly across all MCCS channels and touchpoints using transaction and 1st party customer data sources?

- **Project Description:** VTEC students will examine data from Point-of-Sale transactions, subscriber lists, social media, and other sources to identify the following:
  - Individual Marine needs
  - Explanation of Marine behaviors
  - New processes/procedures

Revolutionize customer engagement by crafting personalized Marine experiences across various touchpoints. This project prioritizes refining personalization through customer and transaction data utilization, while balancing individual privacy and security with personalization, allowing Marine’s to opt-in if they choose.

## GitHub - Jira Integration

To reference Jira issues while committing, building, and deploying code with GitHub:

1. Find the issue key for the Jira issue you want to link to, for example "DD-103". You can find the key in several places in Jira Software:
- On the board, issue keys appear at the bottom of a card.
- On the issue’s details, issue keys appear in the breadcrumb navigation at the top of the page.
Learn more about issues and issue keys.

2. Checkout a new branch in your repo, using the issue key in the branch name. For example, `git checkout -b DD-103-[branch-name]`. 

3. When committing changes to your branch, use the issue key in your commit message to link those commits to the development panel in your Jira issue. For example, `git commit -m "DD-103 [summary of commit]"`.

4 When you create a pull request, use the issue key in the pull request title.

You need to push something to the connected repository for your tools to recognize and sync with Jira. Sometimes, it may take a few minutes for a complete sync to happen.

After you push your branch, you'll see development information in your Jira issue.

Not seeing anything? Make sure you’ve formatted the Jira issue key correctly, using capital letters. For example, "DD-103", not "dd-103".
